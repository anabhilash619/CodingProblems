problems statements:

1:Collect Apples:
		Given a M*N matrix, where every cell represents the quantity of apples present at that location.Find the maximum number of apples
		that can be collected while traversing through the grid(only down and right are allowed).The initial position is arr[0][0] and the 
		destination is the last element of last row and last column;
		
2:longest common subsequence:
		Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence between two strings.A longest common subsequence can be defined as a sequence 
		of characters(need not be continuous) that are present in both the strings.
		
3:longest common substring:
		Given two strings, find the longest common substring of both the strings.A longest common substring can be defined as the substring 
		present in both the strings but of the maximum length.
		
4:longest increasing subsequence:
		Given two integer arrays, find the longest common subsequence,An increasing subsequence can be considered as a sequence which (need
		not be continuous, but has to be in increasing order.for example consider 1,6,2,0, 4,3 ....etc. 1,2,3 or 1,2,4 or 0,3 can be considered
		as an increasing sequence), Find the sequence of longest length.
